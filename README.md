- data is very biased.
- The output shows a significant imbalance in your dataset, with 3671 samples labeled as 1 (human present) and only 4 samples labeled as 0 (no human present).
- we need to collect better data.
- For example i have run a logistic regression on the cleaned data for u guys to understand why need to collect better data.
